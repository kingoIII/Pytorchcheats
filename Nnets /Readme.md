Perfect — I get what you want now: not just code, not just summary, but a “study notebook” style rewrite. Lots of notes in plain language, each step explained, and maybe even some “why it matters” comments so it’s easier to learn, not just copy.

Here’s a rewritten version of your “More Hidden Neurons” lab as if it were a polished cheat-sheet/lesson:

🧠 Lesson: Adding More Hidden Neurons

⸻

🎯 Main Goal

Learn how adding more neurons in the hidden layer makes a neural network more flexible, allowing it to classify data that a simple model can’t.

⸻

🔹 Step 1: The Problem
	•	If we use just one decision function (like a line or a single sigmoid), it misclassifies many points.
	•	Shifting or scaling the line doesn’t help.
	•	👉 The model is too simple.

⸻

🔹 Step 2: The Idea
	•	Each hidden neuron produces a “bump” function (sigmoid or ReLU shape).
	•	If you combine several of these bumps (through weighted sums), you can approximate very complex shapes.
	•	More neurons = more bumps = more flexibility.

Think of it like Lego:
	•	1 block → boring.
	•	7 blocks → you can build a curve, staircase, or anything you want.

⸻

🔹 Step 3: Implementation in PyTorch

Using nn.Module

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define the network
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.hidden = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)   # hidden layer
        self.output = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size) # output layer
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.sigmoid(self.hidden(x))   # activation makes it nonlinear
        x = torch.sigmoid(self.output(x))
        return x

# Create the model with 6 hidden neurons
model = Net(input_size=2, hidden_size=6, output_size=1)

# Loss and optimizer
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)


⸻

Using nn.Sequential (cleaner)

model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(2, 7),   # 7 hidden neurons
    nn.Sigmoid(),
    nn.Linear(7, 1),
    nn.Sigmoid()
)


⸻

🔹 Step 4: Training Loop

(Same as logistic regression)

for epoch in range(1000):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    y_pred = model(X)
    loss = criterion(y_pred, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()


⸻

🔹 Step 5: Results
	•	With 6–7 hidden neurons, the decision boundary bends into the right shape.
	•	Misclassified samples drop drastically.
	•	The model is finally flexible enough to separate the classes.

⸻

📝 Notes to Remember
	•	Too few neurons → underfitting (model is rigid).
	•	More neurons → flexible (captures data pattern).
	•	Too many neurons → overfitting (memorizes training set, bad on new data).
	•	Activation functions are essential — without them, more layers/neurons would still collapse to a straight line.

⸻

💡 Big Picture

This lab is showing you the building block idea:

By stacking more neurons, you let the network “compose” more complex shapes.

That’s the same principle behind huge LLMs like GPT — but instead of 7 neurons, they use billions of parameters across many layers.

👉 Want me to now take this and turn it into a Markdown study note (hidden_neurons.md) you can drop directly into your Pytorchcheats repo, with headings, code blocks, and comments?
